* The `install.sh` script automates my installation of Arch Linux with my configurations that requieres root.
* The `r.sh` script restores my config that requieres non-root when installing Arch Linux with `install.sh`
* The `estore.sh` script restores my config after installing Arch Linux
* It is not guarenteed that `install.sh` will work as it is still WIP and is extremely unstable. Use it at your own risk! I recommend typing word by word from the script instead of running `install.sh`

# IMPORTANT NOTICE
* The scripts above installes my personal preferences and doesn't prompt for anything! Please edit before using them. Use it at your own risk!
* The `install.sh` script should not be run! It's extremely unstable and is currently used as my installation note. I still manually type them in the console instead of running it.
